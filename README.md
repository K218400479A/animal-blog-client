The Animal Blog website is my first project utilizing the MERN stack. The website allows the user to register for an account and perform basic CRUD operations on animal entries. 

This website uses the React library to build user interface components for the client. Express runs the backend server connected with MongoDB database. Users are authenticated by a json web token stored in a cookie on the browser.
